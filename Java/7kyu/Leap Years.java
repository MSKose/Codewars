In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

Years divisible by 4 are leap years,
but years divisible by 100 are not leap years,
but years divisible by 400 are leap years.
Tested years are in range 1600 ≤ year ≤ 4000.
*/

// my solution
public class LeapYears {
    public static boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
        return year % 100 > 0 && year % 4 == 0 || year % 400 == 0;
    }
}
